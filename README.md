# Spending Analysis
An 18-month spending analysis and visualization of annual banking statements with Python. Features were selected, engineered, and data was bucketed and manipulated before being graphed for several metrics. This was done through Jupyter notebooks, and utilizes Pandas and NumPy libraries, as well as [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/victor.chen1615/viz/18-monthSpendingAnalysis/SpendingbyCategory?publish=yes) for the visualization.
