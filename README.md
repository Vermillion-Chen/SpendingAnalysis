## Python-Tableau Spending Analysis
#### An 18-month spending analysis and visualization of annual banking statements with Python. Features were selected, scaled, and engineered. After the data manipulation and bucketing, outliers removed, and proportional calculations were also done before being graphed for several metrics. This project was done through Jupyter notebooks, and utilized Pandas and NumPy libraries, as well as [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/victor.chen1615/viz/18-monthSpendingAnalysis/SpendingbyCategory?publish=yes) for the visualization.
