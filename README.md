## Python-Tableau Spending Analysis
#### I enjoy performing a spending analysis every 18 months to confirm I have not been corrupted by secular desires. The routine development of these keep my data engineering and visualization abilities sharp, and also show my growth and habit trends over time. These 18-month spending analyses and visualization of annual banking statements with Python. Features were selected, scaled, and engineered. After the data manipulation and bucketing, outliers removed, and proportional calculations were also done before being graphed for several metrics. This project was done through Jupyter notebooks, and utilized Pandas and NumPy libraries, as well as

Sometime between 2021 and 2023, I learned about .gitignore, and this allowed me to create a binning function that was external to the files on git, and store my banking and censoring locally as well. The categories and scale are notably different, because as I mature, my priorities and responsibilities change, including managing rent and utilities, my own office space, and purchasing groceries.
